# Math-24-Game
The 24-Game offers an arithmetic challenge where players craft expressions using basic mathematical operations to achieve a target of 24.

Players can select from multiple difficulty levels, ranging from Easy to Hard, altering the challenge to their expertise. At its core, the project uses custom stack data structures for efficient parsing and real-time evaluation of player inputs, ensuring both mathematical and syntactical accuracy. The provides immediate feedback, guiding players through their mistakes and achievements. Built using C for core game logic and data structures, this interactive program serves as a fun brain exercise
